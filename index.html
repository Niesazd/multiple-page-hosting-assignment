        A croissant (UK: /ˈkrwʌsɒ̃, ˈkrwæsɒ̃/, US: /krəˈsɒnt, krwɑːˈsɒ̃/, French:
        [kʁwasɑ̃]) is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the
        Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
        dough.Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The
        dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
        succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to
        a puff pastry.
        <br /><br />
        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
        crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.The modern croissant was
        developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the
        brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.
        <br /><br />
        In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed
        but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked
        by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie
        chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of
        2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries
        were baked from frozen dough.
        <br /><br />
        Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European
        countries and served as dessert all around the world.
